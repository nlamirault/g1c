## Configuration

g1c will look for configuration in the following locations:

1. Command line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file at `~/.config/g1c/config.toml`

Example configuration file:

```toml
default_project = "my-project-id"
default_region = "us-central1"
refresh_interval = 3 # seconds
theme = "dark"
```

## Authentication

g1c uses the standard Google Cloud authentication methods through the gcloud CLI. Make sure you have:

1. Google Cloud SDK installed and configured
2. Authenticated with `gcloud auth login`
3. Set a default project with `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID` or use the `--project` flag

You can check your authentication status with:

```bash
make check-env
```

## Development

- Google Cloud SDK

### Building

```bash
# Check code
make check

# Format code
